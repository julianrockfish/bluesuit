<h4> 	BSXXXD - HONEYBOY EDWARDS: WHITE WINDOWS </h4> 
<p> Considered the best work by Delta Bluesman Honeyboy Edwards, this historical recording is a link to the plantations and juke joints that define the Delta Blues. Honeyboy's acoustic slide guitar will take listeners back to "61 Highway" and his voice eminates the experiences of a well traveled blues legend. <a href="#">  Order from Blue-Suit </a> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/white-windows/id182379302?uo=4" target="itunes_store"><img src="http://r.mzstatic.com/images/web/linkmaker/badge_itunes-sm.gif" alt="White Windows - David "Honeyboy" Edwards" style="border: 0;"/></a> </p>

<h4> BS105D - 	
DETROIT JUNIOR: TURN UP THE HEAT </h4> 
<p>  Turn Up The Heat is the first full length album from Chicago blues club legend Detroit Junior. His resume impresses as he recorded with Chess Records in the 60’s and eventually joined Howlin Wolf’s band in the 70’s. Detroit’s fun loving sound is evident all over this record, as Turn Up The Heat’s boogie woogie will sure to have the dance floors rockin’.

<h4> BS106D - 	
HOWARD ARMSTRONG: LOUIE BLUIE </h4> 
<p>  Howard Armstrong has been called the last of the black string band musicians. He can play over 22 instruments but focuses on fiddle and mandolin. Armstrong was 86 years old when these fantastic sessions were recorded, but there was no sign of declining skills as he tackled spirituals, traditional folk pieces, classic jazz, and even a pair of Gershwin compositions. Perhaps one of, if not the most, unique and beautiful album Blue-Suit has ever recorded. <a href="#"> Order from Blue-Suit  </a> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/louie-bluie/id123120895?uo=4" target="itunes_store"><img src="http://r.mzstatic.com/images/web/linkmaker/badge_itunes-sm.gif" alt="Louie Bluie - Howard Armstrong" style="border: 0;"/></a> </p>

<h4> BS107D - 	
LOUIS "MR BO" COLLINS: IF TROUBLE WAS MONEY
 </h4> 
<p>  When Detroit blues artist Mr. Bo recorded this album in February, 1995 it had been 20 years since he had recorded professionally. Highly regarded for a handful of 45s he had recorded for various Detroit labels during the '50s, '60s and '70s, his recording career had taken a long hiatus while his live performing career continued to thrive. Mr. Bo unfortunately passed away before the release of this album, but it serves as a testament to his career.

<h4> BS108D - 	
QUEENS OF HARMONY: I EXPECT A MIRACLE
 </h4> 
<p>  The hottest traditional gospel around is being sung by an exciting seven voice group from Toledo, OH. The Queens  are actually two groups - the original Queens of Harmony and the daughters of the Queens, princesses if you will. Rousing leads and beautiful harmonies backed by the driving piano of Professor Eugene Silas is  tremendously earthy as well as heavenly. When you hear their voices you'll be convinced that they're all royalty.<a href="#"> Order from Blue-Suit  </a></p>

<h4> BS109D - 	
DETROIT JUNIOR: TAKE OUT THE TIME </h4> 
<p>  The 2nd album from the premier blues piano entertainer. Detroit Junior has been thrilling audiences since he recorded "Call My Job" in the 1950s and he's back and in his best form. Backed once again by Maurice John Vaughn and his tight band, with a special guest appearance by Eddie Burns, "Take Out The Time" captures Detroit Junior at his partying best.

<h4> BS110D - 		
HASTINGS STREET GREASE: DETROIT BLUES IS ALIVE!  VOL 1 </h4> 
<p>  	Hastings Street was the center of African American culture in Detroit from the 1930s through the early 1960s and this album captures some of the greatest bluesmen from  that era in a collection of new recordings. The musicians on Hastings Street Grease include Eddie Burns, Eddie Kirkland, Howard Armstrong, Willie D. Warren, Harmonica Shah and Detroit Piano Fats. Recorded in 1998, but with a taste of 1950's detroit blues, this is a must for any Blue-Suit collector. <a href="#"> Order from Blue-Suit  </a>  </p>

<h4> 	BS111D
HASTINGS STREET GREASE: DETROIT BLUES IS ALIVE!  VOL 2 </h4> 
<p> HSG V2 is a second generous helping of modern-day Motor City sounds. The raw energy and drive of the Detroit blues is alive as ever. This record has an aura almost as if the musicians had come straight to the recording studio from their gigs at some of the little joints on Hastings back in the day. <a href="#"> Order from Blue-Suit  </a> </p>

<h4> THE DYNATONES: SHAKE THAT MESS </h4> 
<p>  The Hardest Working Band in America is back at it again with Shake That Mess. Known for getting the dance floor moving, the Dynatones deliver as promised. The Dyantones are truely trensetters as this album was one of the popular releases of the recent retro-soul movement.<a href="#"> Order from Blue-Suit  </a> </p> <iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:2LvRw1OLKazzsGHi9hXq7Q" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<h4> 	BS114D
HARMONICA SHAH: MOTOR CITY MOJO </h4> 
<p>  Respected Detroit bluesman Harmonica Shah released his 1st album with Blue Suit Records. This album is unique as Shah's own songwriting leans heavily on his antecedents, but he has also developed a harsh ghetto blues with stream on conscience lyrics drawn upon his experience and imagination alike. This is Motor City blues at its finest.<a href="#"> Order from Blue-Suit  </a> </p>

ART & ROMAN GRISWOLD: COCK-EYED WORLD </h4> 
<p>  in 2000, when you were worrrying about Y2K, Toledo's famous Griswold brothers stripped their band down to just Art and Roman and drummer Big Blues Bob Michaels. This could easily be the best blues of their careers, with an excellent recording to prove it.  <a href="#"> Order from Blue-Suit  </a> </p> <iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:2NEwIoPwvmDsqlh8SoKkeT" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

MAURICE JOHN VAUGHN: DANGEROUS ROAD </h4> 
<p>  	
The first recording by Maurice John Vaughn since 1993 shows that he is one of the best blues producers (as well as one hell of a guitarist) active today. This is the kind of blues record you drop the top to on lake shore drive and blast "Love Abuse". <a href="#"> Order from Blue-Suit </a> </p>

<h4> 	BS117D
MOTOR CITY RHYTHM & BLUES PIONEERS </h4> 
<p>  Before Motown, Detroit had a very vibrant R&B music scene. The best known of the genre were Falcons alumni Wilson Pickett, Eddie Floyd & Mack Rice, but there were others too - Joe Weaver, Stanley Mitchell & Kenny Martin. Stanley recorded for Chess Records in the 1950s, and Weaver was one of the house band at Detroit's famous Fortune Records backing everyone who came to town. In fact, His band, the Blue Notes, played on many of the formative Tamla sessions, effectively establishing the sonic blueprint later honed to perfection by the Funk Brothers. Martin cut a couple hit singles for Federal as a teenager in '57 & '58. Here all three friends present a vintage R&B revue, conjuring up the magic of their collective past. #R&B #SOUL <a href="#"> Order from Blue-Suit </a> </p>

DETROIT JUNIOR: LIVE AT THE TOLEDO MUSEUM OF ART </h4> 
<p>  	
Recorded live at the Toledo Museum of Art's 100th birthday celebration in June, 2001. Here Detroit's music is captured in it's essence, the performance. <br> <br>  <strong>"When I'm playing and singing, I try to live it in, live it out, let 'em feel it. That makes me feel good, even though I'm still a poor, scuffling musician. That's the one thrill I get, is seeing people enjoy. I don't do things just for the money. I do things because I enjoy it, and I like to see the people enjoy it."</strong> Detroit Junior <a href="#"> Order from Blue-Suit </a> </p>

EDDIE KIRKLAND: DEMOCRAT BLUES </h4> 
<p>  Democrat Blues captures the Energy Man in the fall of 2002 as he came back through his former hometown, Toledo. The effects on Kirkland's guitar are legendary to those who've seen him perform and some of them are right out front on the first tune on Democrat Blues. This is Kirkland’s finest release since the 1970’s. The album also contains a bonus disc with the all the songs by Eddie Kirkland released on Blue Suit's Hastings Street Grease: Detroit Blues Is Alive! Series and one unreleased track from those sessions.

EDDIE BURNS: SECOND DEGREE BURNS</h4> 
<p>  Eddie "Guitar" Burns has been a fixture of the Detroit blues scene since his arrival in the late 1940s when he recorded with John Lee Hooker. He became Hooker's guitar player for a long stretch, but also achieved notoriety as a songwriter, the most successful was "Orange Driver" which was covered by the J. Geils Band. Burns also recorded for Chess and Motown. On this album he does some songs from his stint with Motown (their only blues artist) and many newly penned tunes.

<p>  Newly released recordings by the late Dave 'Snaker' Ray, known to many as a member of the seminal folk-blues trio Koerner, Ray & Glover, recorded in the last year of his life. Mining the rich oeuvre of American blues and folk music with extraordinary 12 string guitar playing (as well as 6 string & electric too) and his resonant vocals, Dave Ray gives us a performance to remember him by.
